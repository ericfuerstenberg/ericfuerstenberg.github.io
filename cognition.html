        <h1>Age-related Patterns of Cognitive Performance in a Population of Bolivian Forager-Farmers</h1>

        	Normal cognitive aging is characterized by at least two distinct trajectories over the life course. Fluid abilities (e.g., conceptual reasoning, processing speed, and memory) increase consistently throughout early adolescence and decline nearly linearly beginning in early adulthood, while crystallized abilities such as breadth of vocabulary and general knowledge continue to grow throughout adult life and are remarkably resilient even at late age. This pattern has been consistently replicated in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, and as a result is generally considered to be representative of the standard human cognitive aging profile.  However, there have been few if any attempts to document this pattern in non-industrial populations. Here, we compare patterns of age-dependent cognitive development and decline among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists of Bolivia, a traditional subsistence population characterized by minimal access to formalized schooling. Nine-hundred and nineteen individuals completed a battery of eight tasks designed to assess a wide range of latent cognitive traits, based in part on those used by the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS 2003). Our results reveal distinct trajectories for performance on fluid and crystallized tasks, with fluid abilities displaying rapid rises throughout adolescence followed by consistent, linear declines beginning in early adulthood. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to replicate this general cognitive aging profile in a traditional subsistence population with limited exposure to formalized schooling. In addition to replicating the general pattern of cognitive aging reported elsewhere in the literature, we report no significant attenuating effect of educational attainment on cognitive declines throughout late age. We conclude by discussing the significance and utility of an evolutionary framework for future studies of cognitive development and aging throughout the human life span.

        For my Master's thesis I employed generalized additive modeling and piecewise regression to construct a model of cognitive development and aging across the human lifespan. As a part of this project I also leveraged an extensive dataset on household production to assess the social and economic returns to investment in education in developing populations.</p>

		If you have an Android device Google knows where you are. It's a bit unsettling but the resulting dataset is mind blowing. This project was simple; I used the Google Location API to analyze how my daily patterns have changed throughout 4 years of life in Santa Barbara.</p>
