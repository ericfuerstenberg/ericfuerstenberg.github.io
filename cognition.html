        <h1>Age-related Patterns of Cognitive Performance in a Population of Bolivian Forager-Farmers</h1>

        <h4>
        Psychologists have known for some time now that normal cognitive aging (non-Alzheimer's related) is characterized by at least two distinct trajectories over the life course. Some abilities (e.g., conceptual reasoning, processing speed, and memory) increase consistently throughout early adolescence and decline nearly linearly beginning in early adulthood, while other abilities such as breadth of vocabulary and general knowledge continue to grow throughout adult life and are remarkably resilient even at late age. 
		<br><br>
		This pattern has been consistently replicated in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, and as a result is generally considered to be representative of the standard human cognitive aging profile.  However, there have been few if any attempts to document this pattern in non-industrial populations. 
		<br><br>
		For this project, I compared patterns of age-dependent cognitive development and decline among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists of Bolivia, a traditional subsistence population characterized by minimal access to formalized schooling.

        <p><em>Figure 1.</em> Smoothed curve of the effect of age on cognitive performance, controlling for sex and education, based on generalized additive model. Upper and lower lines of each curve represent 95% confidence intervals. Rug marks on the X-axis indicate the range of unique ages in the sample.<br><br>
		<h4><b>Results and major take away:</b></h4><br>
		<p>We can immediately see a distinction between the trajectories of "fluid" abilities and "crystallized" abilities. As expected, fluid abilities, such as processing speed, reasoning, and memory peak around 20 years of age and begin to decline rapidly after age 35. Crystallized abilities (such as vocabulary, general knowledge, etc) increase steadily even throughout late age.</p>
