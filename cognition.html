        <h4>
        	Normal cognitive aging is characterized by at least two distinct trajectories over the life course. Some abilities (e.g., conceptual reasoning, processing speed, and memory) increase consistently throughout early adolescence and decline nearly linearly beginning in early adulthood, while other abilities such as breadth of vocabulary and general knowledge continue to grow throughout adult life and are remarkably resilient even at late age. This pattern has been consistently replicated in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, and as a result is generally considered to be representative of the standard human cognitive aging profile.  However, there have been few if any attempts to document this pattern in non-industrial populations. Here, I compared patterns of age-dependent cognitive development and decline among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists of Bolivia, a traditional subsistence population characterized by minimal access to formalized schooling.
